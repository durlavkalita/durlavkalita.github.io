Threejs gives you wings(3d wings) 🐦💻.

I have been meaning to learn about threejs. Threejs is a javascript library which can be used to create and display 3d image/graphic in a web browser. It uses WebGL. Web development has come a long way since displaying text only in it's early days. Texts then images and then css and jquery and all other styling accessories but it seems like 3d image is the next thing. Threejs uses a scene to display its 3d graphic. Then it needs a camera. A camera is sort of like first person point of view in simple terms. And at last the renderer instance which renders the image using WebGL. Threejs can be used as a npm package or from cdn like every js library and it's api is easy to use with lots of example around. It is definitely something I would like to master. After all who does not like a 3d globe on their website landing page.
