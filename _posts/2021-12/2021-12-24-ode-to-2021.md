Ode vaguely means tribute. Even if I'm wrong there are no English poets who would sue me for this. With the year coming to an end, I believe I should write about it. Also I am out of content to write in the blog so...

2021 was different. But like every other year, at the end I'm alive and, life and learning goes on. Throughout the year my web dev skills increased. Learning nodejs, vue and laravel was fun. Next year focus will be more on python and c++. Writing blog was a huge positive this year. I intend to keep writing and let's see how far it goes. I need to be more proactive and productive so, maybe I will search for some new tech and tricks for that and write about them here.

And ofcourse now that I'm employed in a corporate job, I need to work on my jokes and humor. It will help me when I eventually realize my life was a lie and start doing stand up comedy. ðŸŒš
