Learning solidity to build smart contract and work on blockchain ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¦.

Due to the recent boom in crypto stocks and youtube recommendation I got interested in blockchain. I watched the amazing video about bitcoin by 3blue1brown and since then my interest has been growing. As a programmer after learning the basic concept I thought about using it myself to see how it truly works. But I couldn't find any good solution untill today. I registered for the blockchain development module created by microsoft and I instantly liked it. And that's how I got introduced to solidity.

Solidity is a language which can be used to write smart contract for etherium. Now I won't go in details about etherium and blockchain in general. As I said the 3blue1brown video is very good and there are similar videos on youtube for the basic knowledge. So, solidity language is influenched by python, c++ and js and thus I won't have much problem learning it. A solidity program runs inside an EVM or etherium virtual machine. A solidity program consists of pragma directives, state variables, functions and events at the very least. To know more about them I would highly recommend going through solidity docs and following the get started with blockchain development module by microsoft.
