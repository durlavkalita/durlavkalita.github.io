Roses are red, figma is great üñ•Ô∏èüõ†Ô∏è.

As a developer one thing I struggle with is design. You give me a prototype and I will build you a responsive site but if you ask me to create a ui then - 'ight imma head out'. But ui is so important that i can't not use/work on it. One option that I often have is googling design. Another good option is [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). I'm sure there are more site like this.

But in order to cure this ui phobia is creating your own design layouts. Two of the main option here are adobe xd and figma. I personally love figma. It is easy to learn. Search figma in youtube and watch a half-one hour video on it and boom you can start creating your own design. While working on a recent project I used figma's prototype feature. It is amazing as it let's you handle onTap and other events and does you can see your site in effect without writing a single code. I will continue working on figma and I think you should too.

Slightly related if you need picture or svg for you site, two site I recommend are - [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for picture/photo and [undraw](https://undraw.co/) for svg. For icons, figma has their own plugin (I think) but you can use font-awesome for icons anyway.
