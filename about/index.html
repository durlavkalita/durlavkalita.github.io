Hi, I am Durlav Kalita from Assam, India. I graduated from Assam Engineering
College(AEC) as an Electrical Engineer in 2020. I love working on full stack
projects regardless of tech stack. Currently I am working as a Systems Engineer
@TCS. When I am not working on a project, I am generally procrastinating. But if
I have even more time at hand I play chess and counter strike or fifa. I have
started traveling in recent years and love it. This website is my personal
site/portfolio/blog all in one. Thanks for visiting ðŸ˜„
