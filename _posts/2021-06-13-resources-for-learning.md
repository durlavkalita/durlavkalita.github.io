Learning resources with practice makes perfect programmer ðŸ’».

Learning to program can be tough. Not because there is no material available but because of lack of practice and exhaustion. And I think learning and practicing at the same time is the way forward. While learning web development I came across two sites which are great and definitely worth visiting.

- freeCodeCamp - Maybe more popular one due to their great youtube channel. It is one of my go to channel to learn along with traversy media. But freeCodeCamp's website is what I am talking about here. It has a nice curriculum based learning path ranging from web development to ai/ml. I am continuing their python curriculum now and it's great. After every course they have 5 projects upon complition of which a certificate is provided.

- theOdinProject - Lesser known but my favorite. Unlike freeCodeCamp it focuses only on web development and the projects are between lesson's so it is better for practicing. Along with the normal lesson's there documentation and resource links are excellent. They basically take you and your pc on a journey starting from git to making facebook clone. It is something which I would recommend to anyone wanting to learn web development on a high level.
