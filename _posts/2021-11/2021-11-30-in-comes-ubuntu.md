I finally migrated to ubuntu(again). I recently changed hard-drive to a SSD. When it came to installing an os, I thought about giving ubuntu another try. I had ubuntu before but had to change to windows when I inevitably tried to change some settings. But the temptation of using ubuntu and the bash terminal was reason enough to try it again.

Now the 21.04 version is up and running on my machine. What's left is setting up the environment by installing git, vscode, node and the usual stuff. I always reference the odinbook project guideline when instaling these and they are very useful. The only thing that changed is I am now sync-ing the vscode configuration so that when I eventually start using another os it gets saved.

And changing the the site settings again. Thought about using the hacker jekyll theme. Feeling a bit rebellious and cool might change later :P.
