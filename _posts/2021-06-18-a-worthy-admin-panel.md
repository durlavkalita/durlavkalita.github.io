A worthy admin panel for laravelðŸŽ¡.

Imagine you are creating a nice blogging/ecommerce site with laravel, what is something you most definitely need in the site. Yes it is an admin panel. Just like a wordpress admin panel makes it a lot easier to handle a site an admin panel for a laravel is quite important if you consider user's ease of use. Now you can take up a whole week and create the admin panel from scratch or use laravel voyager package.

Internet is huge and there are other admin panels for you to use but let me tell you why you should use voyager. First is it's free. Nothing tops that. Voyager ui is also very easy to use. With some tutorial available on youtube or from their documentation you can find more about it. Voyager allows to create a new `BREAD` data column. BREAD is just fancy word for CRUD. How it works is suppose you have a product table. You can include the product table in voyager admin panel by specifying it'd model name and other data. Once the table is added in voyager panel, you will have an option to include BREAD in it. It will allow you to implement CRUD operation on the table with a few mouse clicks. Voyager even includes post and products dummy tables. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are multiple things you can do with voyager which you should be able to read in their documentation. So, in need of an admin panel in laravel application? use voyager.
