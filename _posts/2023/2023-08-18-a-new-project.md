If I could save time in a bottle ðŸŽµðŸŽµ... I wouldn't know what to do with it.

After working on odinbook project to a level where it's decent, I am in dire need of a project to work on. Not because I don't have a social life(I don't) but I want to diversify/improve my resume. So I started working on a car rental app. Specially on the backend.

As diversifying was the main motive instead of going with my bread and butter - nodejs express app with mongodb, I went with flask and a relational db. I have previously worked with flask but with limitations. Similarly I had worked on a laravel project with mysql in 2020 but since than I have found mongodb and stuck with it. I thought about using postgresql but for the project I went with sqlite just cause I didn't have to install any extra software.

While working on this project I adapted to using feature branch for github. Generally I push all my changes to main repo but I always thought about using a separate branch and then merging the new changes by making a pull request. First time I tried it(in a different project), it backfired and I had to delete my repo. But this time it worked like a charm. So now code changes are made to feature branch and then merged with main branch. I am also thinking of adding github workflows and other ci/cd things I can do with the project. Maybe I can learn somethings about devops.
