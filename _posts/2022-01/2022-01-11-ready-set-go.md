2022 is here and with it a new programming language. Well not released in 2022 but one that I will learn in this year.

I have been meaning to learn a new programming language for a while just for the thrill of learning something new from basics. I thought of learning java and that was it for java. Being a predominant python and javascript user java is just too much for me. So in comes Go. I remembered a video about go lang released in freecodecamp's youtube site. Turns out it is 2 years old, time really flies I guess. 

The video is great though and basics always remains same so, no problem there. I am halfway through the video now. Go is a mixture of c/c++ python and java. Once you see it's syntax you get it and the language is supposedly faster than c/c++ with concurrency and garbage collection so I will continue learning it and see what can it do. BDW i am using github desktop now ðŸ¥³
