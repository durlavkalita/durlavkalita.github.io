And I don't know how.

If you see my last blog entry, it's dated 24 August. But if you follow my blog (_who are we kidding you love my blog \s_) you wouldn't have seen it until yesterday. Let me tell you the what's and why's of it.

chapter1 what - So, I did wrote the blog on 24 August and sure enough it didn't appear on frontend. I started the repo maybe a year or so ago and all I needed to do since then was write blog entries in **\_posts** directory. It was working on local live server (_everything works locally_) but not on github pages sites. So, like a good programmer I blamed github pages, jekyll and ruby and went about my work.... Until today.

chapter2 why - Turns out I had to update my gem packages dependencies and now it's working. And I don't know how.

_epilogue - I have been inactive both in github and my blog for a while now. With this blog entry I will return to being active again. Let's hope I can continue it for a longer period of time (that's what she said)_
