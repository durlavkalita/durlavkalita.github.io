Configuring python with anaconda and vscode üêçüíª.

So, I had decided to relearn python a few days ago. I learned a fair bit of python in my college days but after I took the web development path I rarely used python. But due to my recent interest in ai/ml learning I am thinking of relearning it and what is the worse that could happen?

Two years ago when I was working on python I used anaconda python interpreter. It is built specially for data science in mind with many module such as numpy, matplotlib etc alredy installed. But this time I decided to change the code editor. Earlier I used spyder with jupyter for python code writting but since I am so well versed with vscode I decided to use vscode now. The integration was easy. In vscode just select python interpreter with the 'conda' name included. It will include anaconda verion of python rather than normal python installion(if you have it) and go ahead importing all the modules you want. To run a program just select the play button on the upper left corner or press  f5/ctrl+f5. If you want to run only a part of code than select those lines and then run(this is something new I learned).

So, if you want to learn python for data science or some advanced stuff I will recommend using anaconda. P.S: I am learning from the freecodecamp.org site for now. Maybe I will follow some book later.
