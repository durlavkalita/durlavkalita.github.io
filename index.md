Hi, I'm a developer. I learn things and implement some of them(at least try), play chess occasionally and write blogs.

### What I am learning now:

1.  C/C++ 
2.  What's a healthy diet
3.  Web Dev


### Some of my posts:

*   [laravel websocket implementation](/post/real-time-with-laravel-websockets)
*   [array datatype in laravel](/post/working-with-array-data-type-in-laravel)
*   [passportjs implementation for authentication](/post/passportjs-authentication)

### More of my stuff:
