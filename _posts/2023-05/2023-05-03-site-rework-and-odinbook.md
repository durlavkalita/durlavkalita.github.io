Odinbook is finally completed (well almost).

I have worked on odinbook project on multiple occasion in last 2 years. At first I used nodejs and vue for backend and frontend. But after creating the backend I didn't complete the frontend part. Then there were attempts to restart the work but every time I tweaked little things on backend for frontend to work and just ended up reworking on the backend. But about a few months ago I started the [full stack open course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) which gave me a little motivation and perspective to start and complete the project this time. The backend was as always 80% done. I did some minor tweaks but it was not time consuming maybe because I used chatGPT. Anyhow this time for frontend I worked with react and because I didn't work on react before I took things slow and step by step and yeah finally odinbook is complete. Well there are tons of things to be added but the basic functionality are all working. The [site](https://odinbook-react.onrender.com) is live now.

Other than that I just did ome rework on this site. I say rework but it's just mostly spelling mistake correction in previous posts. Thank god I have spell extension. Initially I thought about removing some post as they may contain wrong info about some tech I was learning at that time. But I left it there cause that will show my learning curve and I have to play some cs before office work.
