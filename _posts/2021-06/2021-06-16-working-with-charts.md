Working with charts in web development ðŸ“ˆ.

Working with charts is not something I had to deal with untill recently. Well earlier I made charts with python's matplotlib and so but not for a website. So, I searched for chart sample/ui. At first I thought I would have to write some heavy css stuff but turns out there are many resources for chart making. Some of them are worth mentioning-

- google charts api - Provided by google. Although I have not used it, it looks simple to use you just need to make api requests and send the data for chart. Pie chart or bar graph every thing is there and the ui is very good. I may use it in future as it looks like something wirth learning.

- chartjs - It's a javascript library. I should have expected it as javascript is so popular. It also works fine and again I have not used it but I will someday.

- laravel-chart - Now this is what I needed. I think it uses chart.js in background. I would have liked a laravel package for charts that used only php as with javascript laravel sometimes tends to get messy. But beggers can't be choosers. Anyway I tried using it but there are some problem I am encountering maybe due to my lack of interest in the installation process. The package is legit so it should work. the documentation is not very clear though so, I have to give it some time. And as it uses chart.js so I have to read about that too.
