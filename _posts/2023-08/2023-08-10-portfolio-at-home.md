Can I have a portfolio? -> You already have a portfolio at home.

I have been trying create to a portfolio website for myself. A few years back when I was learning css in depth I followed a tutorial on freecodecamp to build a portfolio. It was created using scss which was great. The portfolio itself was good but it lacked animations. I didn't update much of the stuff there too in recent years.

So, now when I wanted to create a portfolio I went back to that project and tried to modify it, but as most often is the case- modifying/updating a project is rarely easy or interesting. I then searched for portfolio templates and found a github repo of amazing portfolio by other devs. I was amazed but at the same time realized if I have to create a portfolio like that I would have to give it some time and a lot of css which is not my strength.

I did the next best thing, I already have this blog site and I added some projects of mine along with an about section. In future I will also add a resume. I found this resource for sharing [resume](https://rxresu.me) and I will give it a try. The best part of using this site is by default this site has a dark lazy vibe with zero animation meaning I won't have to work on css from scratch. Also in a world of great portfolio's a lazy portfolio like myself should stand out right?
