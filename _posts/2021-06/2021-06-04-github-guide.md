Is this the real github? Is this just fantasy? ðŸŽ¹

If you are a web developer or a programmer you must have heard or used github. So github is a place in cloud where you store your code besides your machine. And it's great for sharing code among people, for projects big or small and everything in-between. So as today let's talk about how to setup a good github profile and maintaining it. I will assume you have pushed code to github before.

- README - Every project should include a README.md file. Many cli provide it by default. Your README should include the project name, description and how to use the project or install it on other device. It is the bare minimum. If you include emoji and project image/gif that's bonus. And if you know enough markdown and html style it in your own unique way. As project is just code, a nice README will entice people and guide them through the code.

- README again - Ok. This README is different in the way that it is your profile readme. Confused? create a new repository with just your username. And you will see the magic happen. For more info google github profile readme.

- github pages - github allows you to host your project site. Once hosted your project can be seen on the web @ https://username.github.io/project_name. To host your project on github, go to settings>pages. To know more about hosting on github and hosting of different web technologies google about it and you will get the answer. There are limitations though. Of course github won't provide a database so your projects should be frontend only. If you need database, try heroku. This is a great way of showcasing your web projects all from one place i.e. github.

- github pages again - Ok. This is again different. If you create a repository as username.github.io, then voila if have your own personal website @ https://username.github.io. In fact my blog is hosted on this site only. Now to create your website use Jekyll. github pages in fact use jekyll. To know more about how to setup your own github website, google github pages + jekyll. It is great because you can use the site as a personal blog/portfolio site which is great for new developers. And try to write a blog entry everyday about things you learned. This will have create a github page of frequent entry and also motivate you to learn new things everyday. And in days when you didn't learn anything but binge watched The Family Man season 2, you can write a blog entry like this discussing how to create github pages blog ðŸ˜‰.
