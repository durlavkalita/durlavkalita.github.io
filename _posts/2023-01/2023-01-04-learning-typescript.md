Learning something new in new year.

I wanted to learn typescript for a long time now. I had registered for the typescript course on udemy by Colt Steele and with new year on weekends it was the perfect time to learn it. I had an intuition that typescript would just complicate my js understanding (which was not much to be honest), but it couldn't be more simple and easy to learn. Don't know about large projects but for smaller projects that I work on using type declaration, null checking and everything will surely be better than using `console.log()` to find error afterwards.

Bdw [learnt](https://realpython.com/python-counter/) about `Counter` method of `collections` library in python which return a dictionary of freq of character of numbers in string or array. Useful for solving leetcode questions.

```python
from collections import Counter
Counter("mississippi")
```

output -> `Counter({'i': 4, 's': 4, 'p': 2, 'm': 1})`
