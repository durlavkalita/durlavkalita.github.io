Conway's game of life simulation ðŸ’»ðŸŽ².

Conway's game of life is a simulation of how cells will behave in certain situation. It was invented by John Conway. So, the logic is pretty simple, a cell can be dead or alive. If a cell has 2 or 3 neighbour cell which are alive then in the next step the cell will be alive or else it will be dead. The rules follow simple biological condition that growth or life can happen only in a ideal situation, not less so as to die without support or not more so as to die for lack of resource.

So, why am I writting about it? Actually the conway's game of life has very simple rules and based on those rules it is easy to simulate artificial situation with a program. I have been reading the Python Playground book and there i found conway's game of life program in python. I have thus read and run the program and I may build it from ground using javascript.

The game of life is not only some fun simulation but it has huge implication on electronics and computer science along with biology. Why and how some pattern repeats itself while some glide through the canvas and other die out is fascinating to imagine. Perhaps watch some video's on youtube about it and you may start to get curious about it.
