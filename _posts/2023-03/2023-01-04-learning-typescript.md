Updates of things learnt.

With the removal of heroku free tier I had to look for some other option to host my project sites. I started the [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course as a refresher for react and javascript in general. The course was really helpful. It had testing, hosting and ci/cd with github actions among other things. So naturally I revamped my odinbook site for umpteenth time. But this time I also had help from certain chatgpt ðŸ¤–. It helped me straighten out my routes according to REST guidelines and also with authentication. I knew about authentication using bcrypt, passportjs and jwt for tokens but after working with the help of chatgpt I have a more mature understanding I guess. Will have to update my medium article on it now though.

Coming to the title of the post. Instead of heroku now I am using render. It's free and simple. Another option was fly.io but it is not totally free so render it is. For now I only have the backend uploaded and running. Will have to include the react app and maybe testing in future.

As long as updates go I was learning flask from a 5-6 year old series of [articles](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) but eventually there were some error with database migration. Oh, I love so love mongo now. Anyway that error will be fixed it's not major. Maybe after odinbook I will complete that series and work on some project of my own. Also learning about docker and devops side of things it's interesting.
