Moving over from react or am I?

Frontend frameworks are great to learn when you already have experience with one. I have been using reactjs for all my projects. Before that I worked with vuejs and used to love it. Working with frontend frameworks keep me close to javascript(well now-a-days it's typescript) and using tailwindcss is always fun.

I had my eyes on learning nextjs for quite some time now and it had everything to do with the hype around it and it's newer versions(goodluck keeping up with it). The versions were actually a hinderance I faced when learning nextjs. I started learning nextjs when v13.0 came out and it had some huge changes. Introducing the app router and many smaller changes in between made all the youtube videos obsolete. So, I am learning from the official [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs) which I have to say is very good.

So, why nextjs. Nextjs uses server side rendering. That just means server renders the whole page content at one go, unlike client side rendering where js has to load and execute for content to be loaded. Thus it's better for SEO and good for static sites. If you want more interaction in your site reactjs is still the better option but for a blog or such sites nextjs is great. Nextjs project can be created using `npx create-next-app@latest` command. The thing that I like about it is tailwind css is provided out of the box. I will be continuing learning nextjs in coming days and write about it.
