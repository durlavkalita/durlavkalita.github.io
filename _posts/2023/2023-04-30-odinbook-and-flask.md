Last time I wrote was on 30 March (30 days ago). Am I the face of consistency or what?

In the last month the odinbook frontend work has been going steadily. Initially every day I added a few functionalities not so much in last week but I will continue that. Except for that I have been learning more about flask.

On the surface flask is just python script nothing special like django but as I have been studying more and more about it there are a few things that I should start picking up. Most notable is the destructuring of the app using blueprints. Diving an app to it's most basic parts is a fetish I am proud to have. Doing it with an flask app is a dream. I am working on an flask app right now and while working on it I figured let's work some more on odinbook while I learn things here. A good approach I guess. Other than this well I have started to play on lichess again. Bad habits die hard.
