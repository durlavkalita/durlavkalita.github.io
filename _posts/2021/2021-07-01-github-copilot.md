Using AI to write codeðŸ’».

You know what's new? github copilot is released today. It is basically an AI that can program. It is powered by openAI and uses GPT3 which is considered as best AI model trainer out there. ALthough there were AI programmer before, this one is supposed to be far better.

Right now it is available as a vscode extension although I am not using it. I just saw a video about it on youtube that's how I came to know about it. How it works is depending on the language one is working on it can generate code from comments or previous code snippets. It also suggests comments and codes. To perform a task it can suggest multiple codes so choose what you like from them. Personally I can't say anything about it until I use it. I like to write my own code but it would be nice to get some help. Just hope it doesn't make programmers obsolete in near future.
