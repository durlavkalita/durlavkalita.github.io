Learning about vuejs static site generator nuxtjs ðŸ“‘ðŸ’».

After working with vuejs in recent times, I thought about learning about nuxt. It is a static site generator and a vue framework. The statement is a bit confusing because vue itself is a javascript framework. Well actually it is not confusing. Framework is a software/technique based on other software which makes it more centered toward other purpose. So, tomorrow I could make a framework based on nuxt too, who knows.

Anyway, the main reason I wanted to learn about nuxt is it's seo friendly along with some other benefits. I had a nuxt cheat sheet from vue mastery site and I decided to use it today. Creating a nuxt app is as simple as running - `npx create-nuxt-app <project-name>`. Then just like vue there are multiple options from linting, js/ts to version control and stuff. One thing I liked is it lets you choose a css framework too so I won't have to manually install tailwind.

The folder structure of nuxt app is simple enough. The pages folder is important one as it contains the pages to be displayed in the site. The syntax is plain vue so, no problems there. I will try and create a todo app and a simple blog in future using nuxt. Then only can I compare it with plain vuejs.
