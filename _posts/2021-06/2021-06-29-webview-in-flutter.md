webðŸ’» =>ðŸ“± flutter with webview and inappwebview.

Being a coder/web developer one always has to lookout for the shortcuts out there. Because unlike other fields taking shortcuts like copying code or predefined using ui components can save so much time which can be used in utilizing other fields.

Now when working with flutter, if you have only a mobile app to build then you should focus on flutter only. But more often than not projects involve a web part along with mobile app part. In those cases imagine how much it will be helpful if one could just show the web part in mobile app specially since web interface is generally made responsive for multiple device screens. Flutter `webview` and `inappwebview` are two packages which help in these matter. They are essentially widgets so, along with the web if you have a special feature for mobile app then you add that on top of that. The webview package is great for displaying pages which doesn't have to deal with much of javascript and more focused on showing the ui. The inappwebview builds on top of the webview feature. So, in inappwebview along with a simple webview you can also include a whole browser inside the app which makes it possible to create app which are javascript heavy on web. Being a flutter dev these packages are sure to help in lot of cases and worth a look.
