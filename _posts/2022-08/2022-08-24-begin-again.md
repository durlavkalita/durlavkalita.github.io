Yeah, the title is a bit ðŸ§€y.

It's been a long time since I worked on a new project or wrote here. So yes begin again with some new project and hopefully I will write about them. I recently completed [Vue - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/) course by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller on Udemy. Well I had already used vue so I just code along with the course project as a refresher and it was great. So great that I am working on a [vue blog](https://github.com/durlavkalita/vue_blog) project now.

With the introduction of vue3 and with it composition api and pinia store, I thought about using it. But I decided to go with options api and vuex for the time being and once the basic operation for blog is taken care of I will migrate it to use those in a new branch. It will help me get a better feel for vue right ðŸ¤¡.
