Yeah I have also read automate the boring stuff with python.

But no this is not about that book. I have been coding along the [python mega course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/) and there I learnt how to not only send email but automate the process using [python anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)'s task scheduling.

Getting the data(in my case news about cricket) from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/) was easy enough. Sending the mail with smtplib library was also very straight forward, just had to register an app in gmail to send the mail from. And python anywhere task scheduling is also as easy as it can get. Just need to add the command to run the main file and time to run it. Along the way got to know about the python-dotenv library which makes using .env file variables similar to in a js web app. The code is available in [this repo](https://github.com/durlavkalita/email-news)

By the way chessboxingðŸ¥µ, what a sport.
