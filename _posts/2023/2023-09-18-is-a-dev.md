The site is now hosted by is-a.dev subdomain.

Last week I was working on a client project for a static site. While looking for hosting and domain name solutions I found an article on reddit(of course). It was about [is-a.dev](https://www.is-a.dev/). Although my github pages hosted site has no problem it's always nice to have a domain like is-a.dev after your name.

The process of registering itself is easy. There are cli and registration options but I choose to fork their github repo and sent a pull request with my site info. That way I will have contributed something on an open source project. Other than that another good thing is I can check activities on the site which I don't know if possible with github pages. That's great.
