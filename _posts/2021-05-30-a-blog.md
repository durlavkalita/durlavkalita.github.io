There are many reasons for one to have a blog. Even if for no one else but for yourself. As a web developer I always wanted a blog of my own. And I have tried a few ways to create one -

- REST blog- If you are familiar with mearn or mean stack than it should be staright forward. Create a blog backend with nodejs and mongodb. You should use mongodb atlas as they offer 2 gb of cloud data for free. Once backend is created use it as REST api. Have routes for showing posts or comments and use React/Vue/angular with fetch api/axios. This is how I created my first blog. I used a node app as REST api and uploaded it to heroku. I created another two React site one to fetch posts and show and another to write posts. The React site were uploaded to netlify but github pages could be used as well. So it was like a JAM stack app. But for a simple blog it's a lengthy process.

- My second attempt at creating a blog is what you are seeing. This blog uses jekyll and is hosted on github pages. gh-pages and jekyll are old pals setup is quite easy. There are many themes available. But if someone wants to customize their site like me they can easily do that. And unlike the first option here you don't need to deal with api or high level js knowledge. You just have to know html. knowing liquid or markdown is a plus. And given a choice everyone should use this.
